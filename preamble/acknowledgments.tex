\chapter*{Acknowledgment} 

First and foremost, I have to thank my research supervisors, Professor Oliver Bonham-Carter, and Professor Douglas Luman. Without their assistance and dedicated involvement in every step throughout the process, this paper would have never been accomplished. I would like to thank you very much for your support and understanding over these past few months. 

\bigskip

I would also like to thank all of the professors at the Allegheny College Computer Science department including Professors Oliver Bonham-Carter, Douglas Luman, Janyl Jumadinova, Gregory Kapfhammer, and Aravind Mohan. Their teaching styles and enthusiasm helped me find my passion for what I wanted to do as well as teach me how to design, execute, analyze and interpret code throughout the entire computer science discipline.

\bigskip

Last but certainly not least, I would like to thank my family as well. A big shoutout to my brother for helping me execute my research and proposed idea. Without him, I would not have been able to accomplish a lot of my work.
