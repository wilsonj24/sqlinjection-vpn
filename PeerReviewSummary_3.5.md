## Summary

The author has provided a well-thought-out approach for completing his third chapter,
'Method of Approach.' Firstly, I like the approach of writing this section in the
first person looks very effective as it is a great way to tell a personal story.
All the essential steps are effectively discussed in this chapter. A suggestion
that could help make the writing stronger is to divide the chapter into different
sections with sub-headings that could talk about the model structure and all the
technical terms that have been used in the process. For example, the dummy website
is an integral part of this research so having a section that discusses the step-by-step
method that was taken to create the website could be helpful to organize the paper.
Also, I think it was a good idea to include an image of the dummy website as that
always captures the reader's attention. Furthermore, the author talks about some
critical issues, such as SQL injection's ethical use, which addresses the importance
of conducting research within this area. Adding a research paper or two, that talks
about or supports this concern could give weight to the argument. Overall, I think
the methods and process were easy to understand, and adding a bit more explanation
and a few scholarly articles will contribute towards leveraging the work done.
