### What is this?

This lab focuses on the importance of not only security but the ethics involved in hacking a database that could be used to exploit a person. The students will be taken through a tutorial that walks them through how SQL injection works, what it is, and how it can be used to harm someone. After the tutorial, the students are then asked numerous questions that tie back into the theme of privacy, security and ethics.
