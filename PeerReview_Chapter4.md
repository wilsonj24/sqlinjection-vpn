### Senior Thesis Chapter 4 Outline

## Overview

In this assignment you are to produce a detailed outline of the fourth chapter of your thesis. Please use the checklist below to ensure your outlines meets the minimum requirements. You are also welcome to use a template below as a model for your outline. Then, you are to have your chapter outline peer reviewed by a colleague. Finally, you must peer review at least one chapter outline of your colleague and fill out the following checklist and answer the questions below.

### Chapter Outline Template: Results and Discussion

I. Introduction

II. Body of the Outline

Topic A: Experimental Design

  1. With the SQL injection technique that I used. I will show how I was able to breach
the database and see the results

      a. Show SQL injection code snippet
      b. Show data in database screenshot
  2. Show/explain why the data within the database is able to by breach
      a. Explain/talk about bad/lazy coding and why it is faulty
      b. Talk about ways to possibly fix it.

Topic B: Evaluation of Results

  1. Again with the technique that I decided to use. I will compare the screenshot of
the code within the database and the code that is displayed on the website

      a. Show screenshot of data in database (sqlite3)
      b. Show screenshot of data in database (Web app using flask)

Topic C: Code Quality Evaluation

  1. Briefly recap why the SQL injection code snippet worked/Discuss ways to fix.
  2. talk about other options/tools/libraries one could use for web application
development. Not just Flask

Topic D: VPN/Tool Implementation

  1. Show how I was able to create my own personal VPN using algo and DigitalOCean
      a. Show screenshots of terminal running algo VPN on DigitalOcean
  2. Show how I was able to create a database in the cloud using DigitalOcean
      a. Show screenshot of database within terminal using DigitalOcean
      b. show side-by-side comparison of how the data in the database is the same

III. Conclusion

### Checklist
- [X] The outline covers one of the required chapters in a computer science senior thesis and it is for the chapter that has not been written yet.
- [X] The  chapter's outline includes a main idea.
- [X] The  chapter's outline includes a list of the topics and major points that support the main idea.
- [X] The  chapter's outline includes supporting arguments and evidence for each topic or point.
- [X] The  chapter's outline includes concluding ideas.
- [X] The writing plan for each section in the chapter has a logical flow.

### Summary

The outline for the author's fourth chapter is well-thought-out and is pretty logical.
The chapter starts by presenting the experimental design implemented in this thesis,
which will help the reader understand the important topic being covered in this thesis.
The author also plans to have snippets of code that will clearly show how the model
was implemented using the computer program. In the next section, the author intends
to talk about code quality evaluation which is a significant step in Computer Science
research. It is imperative to show the reader that the method being used in this thesis
leads to accurate results. Another positive thing about the chapter is the discussion
of other similar tools that have been used in similar research topics. Overall, in
this chapter, images will help understand the results, especially for a reader from
a non-technical background. The only thing that I would suggest is elaborating a
little more on the conclusion section, where the author could write a small summary
for the entire chapter. I think the outline is strong and will help communicate
the results to the reader effectively.
